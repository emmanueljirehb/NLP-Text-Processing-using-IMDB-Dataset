# 🎬 NLP Text Processing – IMDB Sentiment Analysis  

## 📌 Executive Summary  
- This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset. 
- It applies **NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine learning algorithms** to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, achieving **85% accuracy**.  

---

## 💼 Business Problem  
Businesses and streaming platforms rely heavily on customer feedback. However, manually analyzing thousands of reviews is time-consuming and inefficient.  

---

## 💡 Solution  
- We developed an **automated sentiment analysis pipeline** that processes raw IMDB reviews, extracts meaningful features, and classifies them into sentiments. 
- This helps organizations **quickly track audience sentiment and improve decision-making**.  

---

## 📊 Number Impact  
- **85% accuracy** on test data  
- **10% improvement** in classification performance through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
2. **Feature Engineering** – TF-IDF vectorization, feature selection  
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes  
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

---

## 🛠️ Skills Used  
- **Python**  
- **NLTK** (tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF, ML models, evaluation)  
- **Feature selection & hyperparameter optimization**  

---

## 📈 Results & Recommendations  
- ✅ Achieved **85% accuracy** with TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
- ✅ Recommended for **review monitoring, customer satisfaction tracking, and content insights**  
- ✅ Can be extended to **multilingual reviews** or integrated into a **real-time feedback dashboard**  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps & Limitations  
🔹 Extend to **deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)** for higher accuracy  
🔹 Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive review analysis  
🔹 Handle **sarcasm and context** (current limitation of TF-IDF + ML)  
🔹 Expand dataset to include **product reviews, tweets, and global sentiment data**
